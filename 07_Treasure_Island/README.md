Situation: 🗺️ The user is playing a text-based adventure game called "Treasure Island" 🏝️. They have encountered a series of choices 🤔 that determine the outcome 🏆/💀 of their game.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Task: ⌨️ The user made a series of inputs ("left" ⬅️, "wait" ⏳, and then either "yellow" 💛, "red" ❤️, or "blue" 💙) in response to the game's prompts 🗣️, attempting to navigate towards the treasure 💰.

Action: 🐍 The Python code executed these inputs sequentially 順番. It checked the value of each input against the expected choices ✅/❌. If an incorrect choice was made (e.g., "right" ➡️ instead of "left" ⬅️), the game printed a "Game Over" 💀 message and exited 🚪. If the correct choices were made up to the final door selection 🚪🚪🚪, the outcome depended on the color chosen 🎨.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Result: 🎬 Based on the provided code 💻, if the user typed "left" ⬅️, then "wait" ⏳, and finally "yellow" 💛, the output would be "You Win!" 🎉. Any other final color choice ("red" ❤️ or "blue" 💙) would result in a "Game Over" 💀 message indicating the reason for failure 💥. Typing anything other than "red" ❤️, "blue" 💙, or "yellow" 💛 at the final door prompt 🚪 would result in the message "You typed the wrong input" ❓.
