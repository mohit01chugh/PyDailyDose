**🔍 The user plays a text-based adventure game called "Treasure Island" 🏝️.**
      
        They have encountered a series of choices 🤔 that determine the outcome 🏆/💀 of their game.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**🎯 The user made a series of inputs ("left" ⬅️, "wait" ⏳, and then either "yellow" 💛, "red" ❤️, or "blue" 💙) in response to the game's prompts 🗣️,**
        
        attempting to navigate towards the treasure 💰.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**💡 The code executed these inputs sequentially**
        
        It checked the value of each input against the expected choices ✅/❌. 
        If an incorrect choice was made (e.g., "right" ➡️ instead of "left" ⬅️), game printed a "Game Over" 💀 and exited 🚪. 
        If the correct choices were made up to the final door selection 🚪, outcome depended on the colour chosen 🎨.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**🏆  If the user typed "left" ⬅️, then "wait" ⏳, and finally "yellow" 💛, the output would be "You Win!" 🎉.**
        
        Any other final colour choice ("red" ❤️ or "blue" 💙) would result in a "Game Over" 
        💀 message indicating the reason for failure 💥. 
        Typing anything other than "red" ❤️, "blue" 💙, or "yellow" 💛 at the final door prompt 🚪 
        would result in the message "You typed the wrong input" ❓.
