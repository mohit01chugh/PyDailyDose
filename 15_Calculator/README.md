🎯 **The cal() function ⚙️ defines the calculator's operation, taking the second 🔢 input** 

        And performing the chosen ➕➖✖️➗ operation on the first 
        (initially in1, then potentially the previous ot). 
        It then 📤 prints the result.

💡 **The while loop 🔄 allows continuous calculations.**

        It calls cal() to get a result (ot). The user is then prompted to continue with ot or start anew, 
        clearing the 🖥️ screen if they choose 'n' and asking for a new first 🔢 number.

🏆 **Enables users to perform multiple calculations sequentially, using the previous result**

        as the first number for the next operation or starting a fresh calculation.
