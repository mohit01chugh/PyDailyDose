🎬 **Situation:**

The user wants a fun band name. The code aims to generate one by combining the city they grew up in 🏙️ and their pet's name 🐾. 

This is a simple interactive program. 🤔

🎯 **Task:**

The goal is to take two string inputs from the user: their city name 🏙️ and their pet's name 🐾. 

Then, the code needs to concatenate these strings with a space in between and print the result as a potential band name. 🎸

💻 **Action:**

The code first prints a welcome message 👋. Then, it uses the **input()** function twice to prompt the user for their city name and pet name, 
storing these in the **city_name** and **pet_name** variables, respectively. 

💾 Finally, it uses string concatenation (+) to combine the inputs with a space and prints the suggested band name. 🎤

✅ **Result:**

The program successfully takes the user's input and generates a combined string, which is presented as a potential band name. 

For example, if the city is "London" and the pet is "Buddy", the output will be "Your band name could be London Buddy". 🎉
