🔍 **Simulates a game of Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, Scissors ✂️ between a user 👤 and the computer 🤖.**
     
        It takes user input ⌨️, generates a random computer choice 🎲, and determines the winner 🏆 based on the game's rules.

🎯 **The code needs to:** 
                        
                        1) Get the user's choice (Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, or Scissors ✂️). 
                        
                        2) Generate a random choice 🎲 for the computer 🤖.
                        
                        3) Compare the choices and determine the winner 🏆, handling invalid user input 🚫 and ties 🤝. 
                        
                        4) Display the choices made by both the user 👤 and the computer 🤖, along with the result 🎉.

💡 **The code first prompts the user for their choice and stores it. Then, it uses random.randint(0, 2) to generate the computer's choice 🎲.**
        
        It uses a list of images to store ASCII art representations of Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, and Scissors ✂️ for visual output 🖼️. 
        A series of if-elif-else statements then compares the user_choice and computer_choice to determine the winner 🏆 
        according to the game's rules (Rock 🪨 beats Scissors ✂️, Scissors ✂️ beats Paper 📄, Paper 📄 beats Rock 🪨). 
        It also includes a check for invalid user input 🚫. 

        Finally, it prints the choices of both players 👤🤖 and the outcome of the game 🎉.
