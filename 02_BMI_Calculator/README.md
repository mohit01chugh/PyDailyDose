🎬**Situation**

Calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). 
The code prompts the user for their height 📏 in meters and weight 🏋️ in kilograms, ensuring valid ✅ positive 👍 numerical inputs through error handling 🛡️.


🎯**Task**

The primary goal 🎯 is to calculate the BMI using the formula **BMI= {weight (kg)}/{height (m)}^2}**

and then provide a basic interpretation 🤔 of the resulting BMI value based on standard weight categories 📊.


💻**Action**

The code first displays a welcome 👋 message. 
It then uses while loops 🔄 and try-except blocks 🚧 to repeatedly ask 🗣️ for height and weight until valid positive 👍 floating-point numbers are entered. 
After receiving 📥 valid inputs, it calculates ➕ the BMI, rounds it to two decimal places, and prints 📤 the result. 

**Finally, it uses if-elif-else statements to categorize 🏷️ the BMI into underweight 🦴, normal weight 😊, overweight 🍔, or obese 🐳 and prints 💬 the corresponding message.**


✅**Result**

The code successfully takes user input ⌨️ for height and weight, calculates ➕ the BMI accurately, displays 🖥️ the calculated BMI value, 
and provides a basic interpretation 🤔 of the user's weight category ⚖️ based on their BMI. 

This allows the user to quickly 💨 understand 💡 their BMI and its general classification.
