🔍  **The transaction function is called after a user selects a ☕ coffee type.**

        It's responsible for handling the 🪙 coin input and checking 
        if it's sufficient for the 🧾 coffee's cost.

🎯 **The main goal is to process the 🪙 coins inserted by the user** 

        compare the total amount with the ☕ coffee's 💲 cost, and provide change 💸 
        if necessary. It also updates the 🧪 resources and the total 📈 sale 
        if the transaction is successful.

💡  **It calls process_coins() to get the user's input.** 

        Then, it uses if-elif-else conditions to check if the total 🪙 is equal to, greater than, or less than the ☕ coffee's 💲 cost, printing appropriate messages and calculating 💸 change. 
        
        If sufficient, it updates the 🧪 resources and increases the total 📈 sale.

🏆 **The function either completes a successful ☕ coffee transaction** 

        providing the drink and updating resources/sales, 
        or refunds the 🪙 money if insufficient. 
        It also handles cases where too much 🪙 is inserted by returning the 💸 change.
