🔍 **Ordering a 🍕 pizza through a program. The program first asks for the size 🍕 (Small 🤏, Medium 🟡, or Large 🌕),**

    Then, whether they want 🌶️ pepperoni, and finally, if they want 🧀 extra cheese.
    The 💰 price is 🔢 calculated based on these ✅ choices.

🎯 **The 💻 program needs to calculate the 🧾 final bill for the 🍕 pizza 🛒 order based on the selected size and ➕ toppings.**

    It should also ⚙️ handle ❌ incorrect size input and 📢 display the 💲 final cost to the user.

**💡 The code takes a user 📥 input for 📏 pizza size and ➕ toppings using the input() ⚙️ function.**

      It uses if-elif-else 🚦 statements to determine the 💰 base 🍕 pizza cost based on the 📏 size.

      Another if-elif-else 🚦 block adds the 💰 cost of 🌶️ pepperoni based on whether it's  desired and the pizza size. 

      Finally, an if-else 🚦 statement adds $1 for 🧀 extra cheese if the user chooses 'Y'. 

      The 📢 print() ⚙️ function is used to 📣 display the initial  choices and the 💲 final calculated 🧾 bill. 

      The 🚪 sys.exit() ⚙️ function is used to 🛑 terminate the program if an ❌ invalid pizza size is entered.
