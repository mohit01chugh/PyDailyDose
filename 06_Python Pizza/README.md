🔍 
Ordering a 🍕 pizza through a 💻 program. The program first ❓ asks for the 📏 size 🍕 (Small 🤏, Medium 🟡, or Large 🌕), 

Then, whether they want 🌶️ pepperoni, and finally, if they want 🧀 extra cheese. The 💰 price is 🔢 calculated based on these ✅ choices.


🎯 
The 💻 program needs to ➕➖ calculate the 🧾 final bill for the 🍕 pizza 🛒 order based on the selected size and ➕ toppings. 

It should also ⚙️ handle ❌ incorrect size <0xF0><0x9F><0x94><0xB3> input and 📢 display the 💲 final cost to the 🧑‍💻 user.


💡 The code takes a user 📥 input for 📏 pizza size and ➕ toppings using the input() ⚙️ function. 

It uses if-elif-else 🚦 statements to determine the 💰 base 🍕 pizza cost based on the 📏 size. 
Another if-elif-else 🚦 block ➕ adds the 💰 cost of 🌶️ pepperoni based on whether it's  desired and the 📏🍕 pizza size. 
Finally, an if-else 🚦 statement ➕ adds $1 for 🧀 extra cheese if the 🧑‍💻 user chooses 'Y'. 

The 📢 print() ⚙️ function is used to 📣 display the initial  choices and the 💲 final 🔢 calculated 🧾 bill. 
The 🚪 sys.exit() ⚙️ function is used to 🛑 terminate the 💻 program if an ❌ invalid 📏🍕 pizza size is ➡️ entered.


🏆 The 💻 program 👍 successfully ➕➖ calculates and 📢 displays the 💲 final 🍕 pizza 🧾 bill based on the 🧑‍💻 user's selections. 

It also 💬 provides feedback on the chosen options and ⚙️ handles ❌ invalid 📏🍕 size <0xF0><0x9F><0x94><0xB3> input by 🚪 exiting.
