🎯 **To create a loop 🔄 that makes the turtle move forward ➡️** 
        
        lift its pen penup(), move forward again, and 
        then put its pen down pendown(), repeating this 
        to simulate a dashed line effect. This needs to happen 30 times.

💡  **To repeat the following 30 times: the turtle moves forward 5 units**

         lifts its pen up penup() , moves forward another 5 units, 
         and puts its pen down pendown().
